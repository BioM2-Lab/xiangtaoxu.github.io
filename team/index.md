#### Join us if you are interested in ecological modeling, environmental remote sensing, and forest ecosystem dynamics across the globe!

- **Undergraduates** can work as summer research interns or enroll in research-for-credit courses
- **Graduate applicants** please refer to Cornell EEB website for the [application process](https://ecologyandevolution.cornell.edu/graduate) and feel free to reach out to me or other lab members.
- **Postdoc** opportunties are available pending on funding. I am more than happy to support fellowship opportunities such as [NSF PRFB](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/postdoctoral-research-fellowships-biology-prfb), [NOAA Climate & Global Change Fellowship](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc) and other opportunities at Cornell such as the [Atkinson Postdoctoral Fellowship in Sustainability](https://postdocs.cornell.edu/prospective-postdocs/cornell-postdoctoral-fellowship-programs/#atkinson) and the [Schmidt Postdoc](https://science.ai.cornell.edu/people/schmidt-postdocs/) by Cornell University AI for Science Institute.
