New paper titled "Two sub-annual timescales and coupling modes for terrestrial water and carbon cycles" is now published [online](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.17463) in _Global Change Biology_. Dr. Dan Gianotti from MIT CEE is the lead author while Xiangtao Xu of the BioM2 Lab is a co-author. Using remote sensing data, the study identifies two dominant modes of terrestrial water and carbon cycles across the Contiguous United States: (1) a negative correlation timescale on the order of a few days during which landscapes dry after precipitation and plants increase their carbon uptake through photosynthetic upregulation. (2) A slow, seasonal-scale positive covariation through which landscape drying leads to decreased growth and carbon uptake. The spatial pattern of local temporal dynamics—positively sloped tangent lines to a convex long-term mean-state curve—is surprisingly strong, and can serve as a benchmark for coupled Earth System Models. The study shows that many such models do not represent this emergent mean-state pattern, and hypothesize that this may be due to lack of water-carbon feedbacks at daily scales.
