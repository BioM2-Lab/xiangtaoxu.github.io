**Nick Cranmer** and **Xiangtao Xu** visited two farms participating Cornell Cooperative Extension Tompkins County's Payment for Ecosystem Service (PES) program. The program aims to create a protocol for measuring carbon credit for farm land, where carbon sequestration associated with agroforestry is an important component. In the visit, Nick tested our new WISPR-Livox drone-lidar system (together with curious Grant Xu) and had a successful first drone flight!
