I am an ecosystem ecologist with broad interests in other related fields of ecology and Earth System Science.
My research revolves around the role of vegetation in our Earth system and searches for quantitative frameworks to understand their ecophysiology and make predictions.
I am also interested in novel methods to characterize plant activities across different spatial and temporal scales such as ecological remote sensing.

Currently I teach *BIOEE 1610 Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment* and *BIOEE 4940 Quantitative Methods in Ecology*
